# calc
Simple calculator

This is a test project for jenkins ci.

The project is a GUI based simple calculator. The project contains a build script. I am trying to invoke it via jenkins.

The jenkins project is configured to invoke ant build when changes are pushed to git.

Jenkins artifacts 'out/calc.jar'. Which I will try to deploy on a openstack instance.
