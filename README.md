# calc
Simple calculator

This is a test project for jenkins ci.

The project is a GUI based simple calculator. The project contains a build script. I am trying to invoke it via jenkins.

The jenkins project is configured to invoke ant build when changes are pushed to git.

We can try to deploy the created calc.jar a openstack instance.

flow of jenkins project:
Calc -> JCloud -> Deploy
